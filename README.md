# Introduction 
The goal of this project is to make a full IOT based aquarium monitor / controller.  This project is borrowing ideas or concepts from other similar open-source projects.  The inspiration originally came from [Reef-Pi](https://reef-pi.github.io/) and a lot of the technology inspiration came from [Submerged](https://github.com/jsiegmund/submerged) 

This project is built with Windows IOT Core with a full Azure back-end.  

As you look through the code you can tell it's several years old.  I also haven't really worked on it for a long time.  You'll also see some less than professional merge names because I never really intended to make this public, it was more for me.  I have since decided to get back into technology and I want to have my github full of the various projects I have done.  

Couple notes about this project.  Making an aquarium controller is hard, like really really hard.  There's a reason that there's only a couple commercially available and one that has been around for a long time.  In fact there has been successful companies (eh hem Vertex) that wanted to get into the controller game and subsequently went out of business.

# Contribute
Looking for others to contribute to this project!  I am by no means a professional and would love the oppurtunity to have some other reef hobbyists and/or programmers help out. Please contact me if you would like to be added to the team or feel free to download the code and start hacking away.
