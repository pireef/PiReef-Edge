# Introduction 
The goal of this project is to make a full IOT based aquarium monitor / controller.  This project is borrowing ideas or concepts from other similar open-source projects.  The inspiration originally came from [Reef-Pi](https://reef-pi.github.io/) and a lot of the technology inspiration came from [Submerged](https://github.com/jsiegmund/submerged) 

This project is built with Windows IOT Core with a full Azure back-end.  

As you look through the code you can tell it's several years old.  I also haven't really worked on it for a long time.  You'll also see some less than professional merge names because I never really intended to make this public, it was more for me.  I have since decided to get back into technology and I want to have my github full of the various projects I have done.

# Architecture
Diagram coming soon.  

# Build and Installation
Instructions coming soon once the project is a little more developed.  

TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
Looking for others to contribute to this project!  I am by no means a professional and would love the oppurtunity to have some other reef hobbyists and/or programmers help out. Please contact me if you would like to be added to the team!
